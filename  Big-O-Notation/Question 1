O(N + 10) = O(N), the 10 doesn't matter too much, since N keeps growing.

O(100 * N), N keeps growing based on the 100 calculations no matter how big N is, so O(N)

O(25) => O(1), number of calculations doesn't grow based on N

O(N^2 + N^3), N^3 calculations grow significantly bigger than O(N^2) so O(N^2)

O(n + n + n + n) = O(4n) = O(n)
